# TIKI: choose better data   

### ⛏ Infrastructure for the new data economy, built for those building it.
Decentralized infrastructure to create private, safe, and compliant data transactions between people and businesses —more control, transparency, and value. Build the new data economy with TIKI.

- 🤑 **Add data incentive programs**  
like discounts, loyalty programs, and gated features to your product.  
*Did you know, without an incentive, <20% of US iOS users opt-in to data [tracking](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212025)?*  



- 🦺 **Reduce risk and compliance costs**  
with managed consent and an immutable audit trail.  
*Did you know [71%](https://unctad.org/page/data-protection-and-privacy-legislation-worldwide) of the world’s countries have data protection and privacy legislation?*  



- 📈 **Buy/Sell/License**  
zero, first, and third-party data (legally), with automated provenance and ownership rights.   
*third-party data coming soon.*

### ⛔️ All-encompassing ToS don't cut it anymore. 
[People](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-consumer-privacy-survey-2022.pdf) expect more transparency, control, and compensation for their data. Privacy requirements are piling up and opt-in rates [plummetting](https://www.flurry.com/blog/att-opt-in-rate-monthly-updates/) for businesses.

The thing is, less data isn't the answer...  `less data = worse products & services`

### 🧙‍♂️ Get Started
Our DEX is a growing collection of SDKs, APIs, and templates to help you quickly build the features you want and get the data you need. **No expertise in data, privacy, or crypto needed** (but if you have some, everything is open source, throw us a PR).

### [Peep the Docs →](https://docs.mytiki.com)  
We have getting-started guides, API references, recipes, examples, and more.

#### SDK(s)
The primary method for using TIKI. As decentralized infrastructure, the vast majority of it runs at the edge. Hence SDKs —cloud APIs are so 2015 😝.

- **Android**: [tiki-sdk-android](https://github.com/tiki/tiki-sdk-android) - Dart SDK compiled to machine code combined with platform-specific storage and a native Kotlin API. Just add to your build.gradle.  



- **iOS**: [tiki-sdk-ios](https://github.com/tiki/tiki-sdk-ios) - Dart SDK compiled to machine code combined with platform-specific storage and a native Swift API. Just add to your podfile.



- **Flutter**: [tiki-sdk-flutter](https://github.com/tiki/tiki-sdk-flutter) - Combines Dart SDK with Flutter-specific storage libs. Just add to your pubspec.



- **Dart**: [tiki-sdk-dart](https://github.com/tiki/tiki-sdk-dart) - Core implementation including blockchain (assembler, validator, wallet, etc.), ownership minting, and consent handling. Used by Flutter, iOS, and Android SDKs.

#### Layer 0
Services to support the TIKI DEX. You rarely, if ever, need to interact with these systems directly; our SDKs take care of it all for you.

- **LT Storage**: [l0-storage](https://github.com/tiki/l0-storage) - Provides long-term (10+ years) immutable (WORM) low-frequency read block backup in a cloud-hosted bucket.



- **Auth**: [l0-auth](https://github.com/tiki/l0-auth) - OAuth2 (using JWTs) style authorization provisioning access to TIKI's L0 services. 

### 🤖 How it works
 
TIKI is a **decentralized data exchange** (DEX) backed by novel ⛓ [blockchain tech](https://github.com/tiki/.github/blob/main/profile/WHITEPAPER-2CHAINZ.md), purpose-built for data ownership. 

Add direct people-to-business data trade to existing applications —meeting privacy requirements and maximizing data flow.

The basics: 

- 🧾 **User Data Ownership** - tokenized (NFT) records of data point, pool, or stream ownership —akin to a digital version of a [property title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_(property)) (e.g., house or car).  



- ⚖️ **On-chain Consent** - an immutable, sequential audit trail for the contractual licensing of user-owned data —like digital versions of [deeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deed#Requirements).   



- 📱 **Edge Based** - using a relative/no consensus model, ownership minting and consent handling happens in real-time, at the application layer, for free. 

*No significant compute, network, or storage overhead. No change to existing backend systems required. Anonymous to TIKI.*
