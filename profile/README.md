### We are on a mission

to flip the data ecosystem, placing users in charge by enabling them to exercise their data ownership rights, resulting in a new fair market for data.

Users own their data. Businesses safely get the insights they need. TIKI facilitates.

### We are building

a vertically integrated user data ownership platform that combines data privacy, ownership issuance, and marketplace.

### Our values

A company is much more than its product. We stand by the following values. If we build it right, TIKI will out last us all.

- **USER-CENTRIC** How could it be anything else?
- **TRANSPARENT** Talk is cheap, so we open-sourced EVERYTHING. Accountability.
- **TRUST** Never take our word for it. Proof is in the pudding.
