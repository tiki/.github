# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For issues related to security within this project, please do _NOT_ create an issue or
disclose publicly without first contacting maintainers.

We are committed to quick response times and responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.
If we do not respond within 24 hours, please feel free to aggressively badger us via
any means necessary. If we let things go for more than 48 hours, publicly shame us
(because we will already have private shame for not responding).

### Private Vulnerability Reporting

The preferred method for vulnerability reporting is via the `Security` tab of the
associated repository.

![Security Tab](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-11069/images/help/repository/security-tab.png)

Not only will this allow you to privately report a vulnerability, but you can also
create a private fork to allow easy collaboration with us on a fix.

You can read more about this feature in GitHub's code security docs[^1].

*Note*: This feature is currently in beta and is subject to change.

### Email

If you are unable to report a vulnerability via the `Security` tab, the team can 
be contacted via email at [hello@mytiki.com](mailto:hello@mytiki.com).
